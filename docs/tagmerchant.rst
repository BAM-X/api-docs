Narrativ Advertiser Tag
====================================

Functionality
------------

The Narrativ advertiser tag allows Narrativ to track user behavior on an advertiser's site. Our AI optimizes
Narrativ's auction system by looking at data on page views and purchase behavior. Any other PII that is
captured, such as names, email addresses, etc. will be hashed and never stored in plain text. The tag runs
asynchronously in the background so there is no impact to page load times.

Implementation
------------

We track two types of events for our partners - check outs and page views

* Place the check out tag on the page that loads after your customer has finished shopping and paid
  for their purchase (your site's equivalent of a "Thank you for your order" page).

* Place the page view tag on every other page that loads during your user's journey, so that we can
  empower you with data on what products they are looking at before they check out.
  Important! Replace "ACCOUNT NAME" with your Narrativ account name in all snippets. Reach out to
  hello@narrativ.com for help with your Narrativ account name as needed.

Adding Information About Your Checkout Page
------------


For checkout events, you have to fill in some information about the checkout before loading our Javascript. This is
done by inserting the relevant data into a variable called window.BAMX_EVENT_DATA. If a field is optional, you can
just leave it out if you choose not to include the data.

::

    <!-- begin NARRATIV jstag -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
        var products = [
            {
                product_id: 'A101',
                product_name: 'Widget 1',
                product_category: 'Electronics > Audio > Audio Accessories > MP3 Player Accessories',
                product_price: 42.00,
                product_quantity: 5
            }, {
                product_id: 'A104',
                product_name: 'Widget 2',
                product_category: 'Electronics > Audio > Audio Accessories > MP3 Player Accessories',
                product_price: 3.50,
                product_quantity: 1
            }
        ]
        window.BAMX_EVENT_DATA = {
            page_type: 'checkout',
            user_id: '1234',
            products_purchased: products,
            order_id: '470',
            order_value: 213.50,
            currency: 'USD',
        };

        (function (account) {
            try {
              var b = document.createElement("script");
              b.type = "text/javascript";
              b.src = "//static.narrativ.com/tags/" + account + ".js";
              b.async = true;
              var a = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];
              a.parentNode.insertBefore(b, a);
            } catch (e) {}
        }("ACCOUNT NAME"));
    </script>
    <!-- end NARRATIV jstag -->

   * - Field Name
     - Type
     - Description

    <!-- begin NARRATIV jstag -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
        window.BAMX_EVENT_DATA = {
            user_email: 'email@gmail.com',

        }
        (function (account) {
            try {
                var b = document.createElement("script");
                b.type = "text/javascript";
                b.src = "//static.narrativ.com/tags/" + account + ".js";
                b.async = true;
                var a = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];
                a.parentNode.insertBefore(b, a);
