Step 2. Associate the product link with the story name
------------------------------------------------------

You can do this in one of two ways:

**1. Create a new article link**

  - Type article name and date next to the gold “+” button, then click SMARTLINK to create a link.
  - (Note: Match the article title verbatim to your site, e.g., “The 15 Best Eye Creams 8/29/17”)

**2. Select from the list of existing articles**

  - Scroll through the drop down box and click SMARTLINK next to the article where you want to generate a link.
  - (Note:  Distinguish links for newsletters by naming your newsletter edits  “Newsletter Date Month”. This is the only way we can correctly attribute orders to the right channel.)

Step 3. Select Dynamic or Exclusive link
----------------------------------------

Need to ensure the link only goes to one destination?

  - To make the link exclusive to your selected merchant for a direct sales deal, click the lock icon.
  - Note that doing this will prevent us from being able to optimize your revenue and replace out of stock links.

Step 4. Create your SmartLink
-----------------------------

  - Once you have clicked the blue SMARTLINK button, the link will automatically copy to your clipboard, and is ready for use in your content.
  - Type the line you want to hyperlink in your CMS (e.g. “Shop Now”).
  - Paste the SmartLink into your hyperlink.

SmartLink Naming Conventions
============================

**1. Edit Name**

Ensure the article/ edit name you create matches the article title as shown verbatim on your site and add the editorial publish date to the end.

  - [Article name] [Date]
  - The 15 Best Eye Creams 9/15/17

**2. Naming newsletters**

Ensure that you distinguish between when you will be using SmartLinks in newsletters vs. using them in articles. For newsletters, ensure you enter an edit name as

  - [Newsletter] [Date]
  - Newsletter 9/15/17

**3. In-article link naming and reviews**

Where you want to include a hyperlink to an internal product review and to a merchant for one product, use the following format, putting the second review hyperlink underneath

  - [Product Brand, Product Name] [Price] (Shop Now)
