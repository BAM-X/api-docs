Narrativ Publisher Tag
======================

Functionality
-------------

The Narrativ publisher tag does two main things. First, it will find any SmartLinks on the page and run
the auctions, allowing the destination of the links to be updated ahead of time. Second, it will track user behavior
such as SmartLink impressions and clicks.

Implementation
--------------

Getting the publisher tag to run successfully is a simple process. Copy and paste the following Javascript snippet
in the HEAD section of all your site's pages.

* Make sure to replace "ACCOUNT NAME" with your Narrativ account name.
* Need to know your Narrativ account name? Log into dashboard.narrativ.com and go to `setup`_ to see the snippet
  customized with your account info, or reach out to your account manager for support as needed.
* See if it's working: There is a checker on your "setup" page where you can insert your site URL to verify if
  the Narrativ Publisher tag is correctly installed.

::

    <script type="text/javascript">
        (function(window, document, account) {
            window.skimlinks_exclude = ["shop-links.co", "shop-edits.co"];
            var b = document.createElement("script");
            b.type = "text/javascript";
            b.src = "//static.narrativ.com/tags/" + account + ".js";
            b.async = true;
            var a = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];
            a.parentNode.insertBefore(b,a);
        })(window, document, "ACCOUNT NAME");
    </script>

Usage
-----

If your publisher account is a member of our LinkMate program, you can enable the
LinkMate feature for your Javascript tag. The tag will automatically scan your article
and convert any regular links to SmartLinks.

Toggle LinkMate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* To enable or disable LinkMate globally for your publisher account, contact us at `hello@narrativ.com`_

* Once LinkMate is enabled on your publisher account, you can toggle LinkMate on or off across your entire site
  by updating the Narrativ window object
  ::

    window.NRTV_EVENT_DATA.linkmate = true;

* Once LinkMate is enabled on your publisher account, you can toggle LinkMate on and off on a
  specific article by updating the Narrativ window object
  ::

    window.NRTV_EVENT_DATA.donotlink = true;

* To disable LinkMate on a specific link, add ``#donotlink`` to the end of the URL::
