# These are the requirements for building our documentation, both locally
# and on Read the Docs. Read the Docs builds must be configured to use
# this file, as part of the "Advanced Settings" for our project:
#   https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/bam-x/advanced/
#
# Note that Read the Docs already provides a default sphinx build environment,
# but we do not use it because it contains some outdated and buggy packages --
# https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues/2398
#
# If you need to update these requirements:
#   1. Add any new packages to `requirements-unpinned.txt`
#   2. Run `pip install -r requirements-unpinned.txt`
#   3. Update this file with the output of `pip freeze`
